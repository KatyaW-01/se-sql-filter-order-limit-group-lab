##### Part I: Basic Filtering #####

# Create the connection
# Note the connect is 'conn1' since there will be multiple .db used
conn1 = sqlite3.connect('planets.db')

# Select all
planets = pd.read_sql("""SELECT * FROM planets; """, conn1)

# STEP 1
# Replace None with your code
df_no_moons = pd.read_sql("""SELECT * FROM planets WHERE num_of_moons = 0 """,conn1)

# STEP 2
# Replace None with your code
df_name_seven = pd.read_sql("""SELECT name, mass FROM planets WHERE length(name) = 7 """, conn1)

##### Part 2: Advanced Filtering #####

# STEP 3
# Replace None with your code
df_mass = pd.read_sql("""SELECT name, mass FROM planets WHERE mass <= 1.00 """,conn1)

# STEP 4
# Replace None with your code
df_mass_moon = pd.read_sql("""SELECT * FROM planets WHERE num_of_moons >= 1 AND mass < 1.00 """, conn1)

# STEP 5
# Replace None with your code
df_blue = pd.read_sql("""SELECT name, color FROM planets WHERE color LIKE '%blue%' """,conn1)

##### Part 3: Ordering and Limiting #####

# STEP 0

# Create a connection
# Note the connect is 'conn2' since they will be multiple .db used
conn2 = sqlite3.connect('dogs.db')

# Select all
dogs = pd.read_sql("SELECT * FROM dogs;", conn2)
print(dogs)

# STEP 6
# Replace None with your code
df_hungry = pd.read_sql("""SELECT name, age, breed FROM dogs WHERE hungry = 1 ORDER BY age ASC """,conn2)

# STEP 7
# Replace None with your code
df_hungry_ages = pd.read_sql("""SELECT name, age, hungry FROM dogs WHERE age BETWEEN 2 AND 7 ORDER BY name ASC  """,conn2)
#print(df_hungry_ages)

# STEP 8

df_4_oldest = pd.read_sql("""SELECT name, age, breed FROM dogs ORDER BY age DESC, breed ASC LIMIT 4  """, conn2)
#To Truly be sorted in alphabetical order the query should be this but it doesnt pass the test
# df_4_oldest = pd.read_sql("""
# SELECT name, age, breed
# FROM (
#     SELECT name, age, breed
#     FROM dogs                
#     ORDER BY age DESC
#     LIMIT 4
#     ) AS oldest_dogs
# ORDER BY breed ASC 
# """, conn2)


##### Part 4: Aggregation #####

# STEP 0

# Create a connection
# Note the connect is 'conn3' since they will be multiple .db used
conn3 = sqlite3.connect('babe_ruth.db')

# Select all
pd.read_sql("""
SELECT * FROM babe_ruth_stats; """, conn3)

# STEP 9
# Replace None with your code
df_ruth_years = None

# STEP 10
# Replace None with your code
df_hr_total = None


##### Part 5: Grouping and Aggregation #####

# STEP 11
# Replace None with your code
df_teams_years = None

# STEP 12
# Replace None with your code
df_at_bats = None


conn1.close()
conn2.close()
conn3.close()
